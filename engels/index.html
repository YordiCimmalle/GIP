      The influences of IT
      <p>My name is Yordi Coussement and I’m 18 years old. I’m studying IT at school which is Immaculata Institute Oostmalle. In my time off I’m always behind my computer. Sometimes just for fun and some social networking, but nearly anytime I make some music. I like making music because it’s my passion. As you can read I’m not a person who likes to game for hours and hours.</p>

<p>My first touch with a computer was when I was 6 or 7 years old I think. We had just bought a new computer and I used it for playing Pinball and for listening to music. First I thought… “Wow this is a cool device” but after a few months it became way cooler because I discovered the Internet. It was something I think I had never heard about but if so I probably couldn’t remember it anymore so it was like a new world. I was browsing through it and I found the first game sites. I always played “Bubble Shooter” or a race game. Damn what a nice period that was! It didn’t take long to find out how messenger (MSN) worked. I added some friend from school and yes you know what’s coming now… I was chatting for hours and hours with my friends. It was something cool because we could talk with each other without a phone. I have to admit… it was a great time!</p>

<p>IT means a lot to me. I use it every day and I think that if it disappears, I will get a depression. I spend 2 to 3 hours on my computer a day and more than 5 hours a day in vacations and at weekends. Sometimes I like to work at some websites myself, but when I’m behind my computer I’m probably working with music. It is something I really like. There are some days that I’m producing music for 7 or 8 hours. Sometimes I also work at night because that’s a moment when I have a lot of inspiration.
It is something very unique because there aren’t many people who can say they know something about the software. I have been doing it for 2 years now and believe me… I always learn some new things about music production.</p>

<p>My ambitions with IT are that I will have a job with a big company where I manage the network. I also want to have my own little company which offers a webhost or other server-based things. Of course I will also keep producing music so I think I will need IT for several years.</p>

<p>After all you can say that IT has become an important part in my life. I use it for several hours every day so I can’t imagine a life without it.</p>
