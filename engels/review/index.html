        <h1>Review about ClickShare</h1>
        <span class="post-date">

        <p>I am going to talk about Clickshare. Clickshare is a tool used for interactive presentations during meetings. It is possible to share the screen of your pc to a large tv screen or beamer.</p>

<p>In my training company they use it in their meeting rooms. In every room there is a big flatscreen and 2 to 4 Clickshare dongles. During meetings they use the tool so the participants of the meeting are able to see what the leader is doing on his computer.</p>

<p>On the internet there aren’t a lot reviews about Clickshare, but I think the reviews I found were very good and told the truth about the tool. The evaluation of the tool was very positive. They said Clickshare was easy to use and that it makes any collaborative process infinitely more engaging. The best thing about it is that it is innovative and currently unique. In my opinion this isn’t completely true, but I’ll come back to this point later in this review.</p>

<p>The negative things I read about Clickshare were the high price to buy the installation, the reset problems and the smartphone software. As you can read, Clickshare is a very expensive tool. To buy a full installation with 4 dongles, you have to count on 4,000 to 5,000 euros. Another negative point is the reset problem. There is a little problem with the wireless receiver so that you have to reset the device and wait 5 to 10 minutes before you can use it again. This is a bit of a shame because of the high price. Let us hope it will be solved with a fresh update in the future. The last negative point was the mobile app. There is a mobile app of Clickshare, but it isn’t possible to share the entire screen of the device. You have to make screenshots and upload them to the app before you can share what you want.</p>

<p>Now what is my opinion about it? I really like the ‘press and play’ feature. You just have to connect the dongle with your PC, run the software and press the button on the dongle. It saves a lot of time during an important meeting which is in my opinion very positive because you know the expression: ‘Time is money!’. As I told before, the point of an innovative and currently unique thing isn’t completely true. There are some other options to share your screen to another screen. Think about Apple TV, Samsung Smart Link and the new Chromecast systems. They are much cheaper and better I think. The best thing about the tool is that it eliminates cables. The only thing you need is the dongle with a 10cm usb-cable. Also the feature to collaborate from multiple devices is very awesome and handy.</p>

<p>What I do not like about Clickshare is that you have to reset the wireless receiver almost every time you use it. Also the price isn’t very good. You have to pay a lot of money for it and it doesn’t always work without issues.
The worst thing about it is the smartphone app. It would be nice and handy if it was possible to share the entire screen of your smartphone to a larger screen, but unfortunately it isn’t possible.</p>

<p>Conclusion… Clickshare is a must have in every medium-sized and large company. It saves a lot of time during your meetings, it eliminates cables and it is possible to collaborate with multiple devices.
The advice I give is: ‘Think before you buy’. Why? There are some flaws and it is very expensive. Maybe you can try to use Chromecast before you buy Clickshare. It can save you over more than 4,000 euros.</p>
